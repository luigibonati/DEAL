## DEAL configuration files

This folder contains the config file for the DEAL (Data-Efficient Active Learning) scheme, which uses the uncertainty on the local environments provided by the GP as a way to identify a small set of non-redundant configurations from a trajectory (e.g. composed by high-uncertainty configurations).

The file deal.yaml contains the default parameters to train a GP model for this purpose using FLARE.
